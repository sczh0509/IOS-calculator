# IOS Calculator

After stumbling upon this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJmRD7kNTk), I was inspired to recreate the IOS calculator application to include in my portfolio. I think this is a great beginner project to showcase fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
